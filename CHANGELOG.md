0.5.0 (2019-10-05)
------------------

 - do not unconditionally read sources.list stdin anymore
     * if mmdebstrap is used via ssh without a pseudo-terminal, it will stall
       forever
     * as this is unexpected, one now has to explicitly request reading
       sources.list from stdin in situations where it's ambiguous whether
       that is requested
     * thus, the following modes of operation don't work anymore:
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir < sources.list
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir http://mirror < sources.list
     * instead, one now has to write:
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir - < sources.list
         $ mmdebstrap unstable /output/dir http://mirror - < sources.list
 - fix binfmt_misc support on docker
